# GPT-Image MCP Server Rules and Notes

## Model Information
- The server exclusively supports OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model
- DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 are no longer supported

## API Parameters
- Required parameters:
  - Generate/Edit/Image-to-Image: prompt 
  - Multi-image edit: prompt, imagePaths
- Available optional parameters:
  - size: "1024x1024", "1024x1536", "1536x1024", "auto" (default: "auto")
    - Non-supported sizes are automatically converted to the closest supported size
    - Size conversion prioritizes aspect ratio similarity followed by area difference
  - quality: "high", "medium", "low", "auto" (default: "auto")
  - background: "transparent", "opaque", "auto" (default: "auto")
  - moderation: "low", "auto" (default: "auto")
  - output_format: "png", "jpeg", "webp" (default: "png")
  - output_compression: 0-100 (default: 100) for webp/jpeg
  - n: 1-10 (default: 1)
  - saveDirPath: Directory path to save images.
    - **MUST be an absolute path** (e.g., `/Users/me/project/images`).
    - Defaults to the server's Current Working Directory (CWD) if unspecified, however, using absolute paths is **strongly recommended** to ensure images are always saved to the *same* location regardless of where the server is started. Relative paths depend on the server's runtime CWD.
    - The server attempts to create the directory if it doesn't exist.
    - A writeability check is performed on this path *before* image generation. If the path is not writeable or cannot be created, an error is returned.
  - fileName: Base filename (default: "gpt-image-{timestamp}")

## GPT-Image-1 vs DALL-E 3 Differences
- GPT-Image-1 is more realistic and consistent but may be less creative/fantastical than DALL-E 3
- GPT-Image-1 supports transparency (PNG with transparent backgrounds)
- GPT-Image-1 handles multi-image inputs natively
- GPT-Image-1 has different size options (1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792)
- GPT-Image-1 doesn't have the "style" parameter that DALL-E 3 had ("vivid" or "natural")
- GPT-Image-1 has more output formats (png, jpeg, webp) with compression options

## Supported Features
1. Text-to-image generation (generate_image)
2. Image editing with mask (edit_image)
3. Image-to-image transformation (image_to_image)
4. Multi-image editing/combining (multi_image_edit)
5. API key validation (validate_api_key)

## API Usage
- API requests use b64_json response format to retrieve image data
- Each generated image is saved to disk with a timestamp-based filename
- The server returns paths to the saved images as part of the response

## Development Notes
- Remember to update all MCP settings to point to "gpt-image-mcp" instead of "dalle-mcp"
- API key is required in MCP settings or as an environment variable
- Default save directory can be specified in MCP settings or as an environment variable
- The server validates API key on startup

## Testing
- Test files include specific tests for GPT-Image-1 functionality
- Tests use real API calls and may incur charges
- Sample test images are provided in the assets directory
